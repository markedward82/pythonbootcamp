#More printing
#now we are going to d a bunch of exercises where you just type code in and make it run. I #won't be explaining much since it is more of the same. The purpose is to build up your chops. #See you in a few exercises, and do not skip!! Do not paste!!

print("Its fleece was white as %s." %'snow')
#display a string 
print("And everywhere that Mary went.")
#display a dot 10 times

end3 = "e"
end4 = "e"
end5 = "s"
end6 = "e"
end7 = "b"
end8 = "u"
end9 = "r"
end10 = "g"
end11 = "e"
end12 = "r"

#display end1 to end6 with a comma
print(end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6 +
#display end7 to end 12 without a comma
end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12)
